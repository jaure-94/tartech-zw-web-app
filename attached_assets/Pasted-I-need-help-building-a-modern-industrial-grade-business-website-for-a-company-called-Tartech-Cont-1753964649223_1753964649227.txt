I need help building a modern, industrial-grade business website for a company called **Tartech Contracting**, which operates in the **construction, agriculture, and mining industries** in Zimbabwe.

The current site (https://tartech.co.zw) is built on WordPress and lacks modern design, animation, responsiveness, and technical functionality. I want to rebuild it using the following tech stack:

- **React (with TypeScript)**
- **Next.js** for routing and server-side rendering
- **GSAP** for scroll-based animations and micro-interactions
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- Hosted on **AWS** for performance and scalability

### 🔧 Design Goals & Features:

#### 🏠 Home Page
- Hero section with animated industrial background (e.g. rotating excavator arm or dust particles using GSAP)
- Clear value proposition like: “Engineering Excellence in Harsh Environments”
- Animated call-to-action (CTA) buttons like “Explore Services” or “Get a Quote”
- Use `next/image` for optimized loading of high-res construction imagery

#### 🛠️ Services Page
- Split by industry: Construction, Mining, Agriculture
- Each service should have its own route (e.g. `/services/mining`)
- Use scroll animations to reveal heavy machinery components or stats
- Embed case studies or client testimonials

#### 📞 Contact Page
- Functional contact form with validation (React Hook Form)
- Integrate with email service (e.g. Formspree or AWS SES)
- GSAP animation on successful submission
- Embedded Google Maps or Mapbox for location

#### ℹ️ About Page
- Split layout with mission/vision on one side, animated timeline on the other
- Scroll-triggered animations for company milestones
- Carousel for team members or equipment gallery

#### 📱 Mobile-First UX
- Use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to create a mobile-first layout
- Sticky mobile nav bar and hamburger menu with GSAP transitions
- Optimize readability and spacing for small screens

#### 🎨 Branding & UI
- Use bold black/yellow color palette
- Heavy-duty, geometric typography
- Custom SVG icons for each service
- Build reusable UI components (cards, buttons, CTAs, headers)

### ✅ Deliverables
Please provide a structured React + Next.js project template with:
- A dynamic routing system for services
- GSAP-powered UI animation examples
- Functional contact form
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
- Placeholder assets/components for each page

The goal is a visually striking, performant, and professional website that reflects the energy, scale, and industrial strength of Tartech Contracting.
